# Contributing to MD Parser
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Feature Request
Have cool enhancement or great feature requests? Then check the following guidelines to request one:

- Search in the existing list and make sure your idea has not been reported already.
- Open a new issue with a relevant template.
- Add as much information as possible. Some valuable information might be:
- Descriptive title
- Clear description of the request
- What value does it bring to the **MD Parser**?
- Code examples or screenshots

## Pull Request
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
6. Provide as much detail as possible
  - Descriptive title
  - Link to the issue that you're working on
  - Set the PR as a **draft** if you haven't finished your work yet.
  - Add reviewers for code reviews only after the PR is done.
  - Make sure all the checks are passing
  - Re-request reviewers after addressing their reviews.

### Git Commit Message
We recommend you to follow the instructions below while writing git commit messages:
- Make it short and descriptive
- Sign your commit with your name and email address

## Submitting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kiranparajuli589/htmlmark/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Short version

The [issue templates can be found here](https://github.com/kiranparajuli589/htmlmark/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). Please always use the template when reporting issues.

### Guidelines
- **Research:** Please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/kiranparajuli589/htmlmark/issues) first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
- **Description:** A quick summary and/or background
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- **Expected:** What you expected would happen?
- **Actual:** What actually happens?
- **Notes:** Possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work
- **Environments:** Information about the system and NodeJS version, etc.

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Coding Style
The project is using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce a consistent coding style.
Please run `pnpm lint` to ensure your code is linted.

## License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project.
